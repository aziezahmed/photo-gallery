# Photo Gallery

A PHP page for turning a http web directory listing into a slideshow for your photos

I like to share my photos on my hard disk over HTTP on my local network.
Rather than see the directory listing, I wanted a simple way to view the photos sequentially.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. 

### Prerequisites

* A web server such as [Apache](http://httpd.apache.org)

### Installing

Place the index.php file in any web directory, and instead of seeing the directory listing you will see the photos.
On a computer you can cycle through them using the left and right arrow keys.
On a tablet/phone you should be able to tap left and right.

```
git clone https://github.com/aziezahmed/photo-gallery.git
```
