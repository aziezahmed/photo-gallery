Photo Gallery
=============

by Aziez Ahmed Chawdhary

I like to share my photos on my hard disk over HTTP on my local network.
Rather than see the directory listing, I wanted a simple way to view the photos sequentially.

That's why I created this photo gallery page.

Place the index.php file in any web directory, and instead of seeing the directory listing you will see the photos.
On a computer you can cycle through them using the left and right arrow keys.
On a tablet/phone you should be able to tap left and right.
